# GitHub Copilot Fundamentals
GitHub Copilot is an AI-powered code completion tool developed by GitHub in collaboration with OpenAI. It uses machine learning models to provide code suggestions and help developers write code faster and more efficiently.
## What is Git Hub?
GitHub is a cloud-based service that hosts software development projects using Git version control. It facilitates code sharing, collaboration, and integrates with various development tools and services. 
## What is GitHub Copilot?
GitHub Copilot is an AI-powered pair programmer that helps developers write code faster and more efficiently. It provides suggestions for code completion, including entire functions, classes, and even comments. GitHub Copilot is based on OpenAI's Codex model, which is a large language model that has been trained on a massive dataset of code.
**Key Features**
1. Code Suggestions and Autocompletion:
   - `Inline Suggestions:` Provides real-time code suggestions as you type.
   - `Code Snippets:` Offers complete snippets for common functions and patterns.
   - `Context-Aware:` Analyzes the current code context to offer relevant suggestions.
2. Language Support:
  - Supports a wide range of programming languages, including Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Ruby, Go, PHP, and more.
3. Integration:
  - Visual Studio Code: Easily integrates with VS Code, one of the most popular code editors.
  - GitHub Integration: Seamlessly works within the GitHub ecosystem, enhancing the developer experience.
4. Learning from Context:
  - Utilizes both the immediate context in the file and the broader project to make intelligent suggestions.
  - Can understand and continue writing comments, which helps in generating documentation.
5. Adaptability:
  - Learns from your coding patterns and adapts to your style over time, becoming more effective the more you use it.
**How It Works**
GitHub Copilot leverages the Codex model, which is a descendant of OpenAIâ€™s GPT-3. Codex has been trained on a vast amount of public code from GitHub repositories, enabling it to provide relevant and accurate code suggestions.

**Benefits**
 - Increased Productivity: Helps developers write code faster by reducing the amount of boilerplate and repetitive code they need to write manually.
 - Learning Aid: Useful for learning new programming languages and frameworks by seeing code examples and best practices.
 - Error Reduction: Reduces the likelihood of syntax errors and common mistakes by providing correct code suggestions.
Usage
## Getting Started With Copilot
**Installation:**
  - Install the GitHub Copilot extension in Visual Studio Code.
  - Sign in with your GitHub account to activate the extension.
**Using Copilot:**
  - Start typing code, and Copilot will provide suggestions.
  - Accept suggestions by pressing Tab or reject them by continuing to type.
**Customization:**
  - Configure Copilot settings in VS Code to adjust how suggestions are displayed and accepted.


### How to generate code with prompts using Copilot?

**Prompt like a comment** <br>
  Give a clear instuctions to generate a required code. based on the prompt CoPilot generates the code snippets.

### How to generate Copilot suggestions as you type?
Copilot codes along with coder based on follow up/previous code in the code file, click `TAB` to accepting the code suggestion

### How to reduce repetitive tasks with Copilot?
GitHub Copilot has the potential to help developers stay in the zone and save cognitive energy during repetitive operations. This allows developers to focus on more important work that necessitates complicated, critical thinking and problem solving.
- Testing (be well defined instructive for efficient code generation)
- give propmpt to creating new function  based previous functions

### How to write documentation with Copilot suggestions?
Maximize the potential of GitHub Copilot in writing documentation and explaining code. Get real-life examples from your code project to enhance your writing. 
- Use `README.md` file <br>
Copilot has the context of your project so it can suggest flow whlie you typing.
